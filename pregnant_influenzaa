<p style="color:white;font-size:150%;"><b>Influenza</b> is caused by a virus, identified as type A, B, or C. The disease spreads in epidemic form and is accompanied by high fever, extreme prostration, aching pains in the back and extremities, and generally, a sore, raw throat. Contrary to early reports, influenza infection has not been clearly correlated with congenital anomalies in newborns, although it can be a cause of preterm labor. For unknown reasons, some studies have shown a link between influenza during pregnancy and schizophrenia in children born of that pregnancy (Al-Haddad et al., 2019).<br><br>Treatment includes an antipyretic such as <b>acetaminophen (Tylenol)</b> to control fever. <b>Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)</b> should be given in pregnancy despite being category C. The risks of full blown flu during pregnancy outweigh the risks of using Tamiflu (Van Bennekom et al., 2019). Because influenza vaccines are made from inert viruses, influenza vaccines can be given during pregnancy (Cunningham et al., 2019).</p>
